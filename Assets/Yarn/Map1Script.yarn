There are Narrator and Bruce.

Narrator: Hi there!
Narrator: What's your actual name, anyway?
    -> My name is Bruce.
        <<set $characterName to "Bruce">>
    -> My name is not Bruce.
        <<set $characterName to "Notbruce">>
    -> My name doesn't matter...
Narrator: Anyway, hi!
End of the Conversation.
